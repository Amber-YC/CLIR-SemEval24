# Parameter-Efficient Semantic Textual Relatedness Evaluation
## Background
The SemEval 2024 Task 1 focuses on Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR), challenging participants to automatically detecting the degree of semantic relatedness between sentence pairs across multiple languages, including low-resource ones like Afrikaans, Algerian Arabic, Amharic, Hausa, and others, which provides an opportunity to expand the focus of STR from English to more languages. 
Litschko et al. (2022) proposed a modular and parameter-efficient framework for cross-lingual trasfer, addresses the scarcity of large-scale training data beyond English in neural (re)rankers. Inspired by this, we introduce a parameter-efficient STR evaluation model that can be used for low-resource languages.
